# A Custom Google StreetView

I work at an awesome co-working space in Cambridge called Intrepid Labs(http://http://intrepid-labs.com/). I have always wanted to play with the Google Streetview API, and this was a perfect chance to do it!

## API
The street view API(as of January 2013)a can be found here : https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/javascript/StreetView

It is well documented and very easy to use. For those of you who are confused, like I was, you need to link to their API dynamically like so:

```html
    <head>
        <script type="text/javascript" src="https://maps.googleapis.com/maps/api/js?sensor=false"></script>    
        ... 
    </head>
```
